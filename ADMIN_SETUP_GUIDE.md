# 🔒 SECURE ADMIN SETUP GUIDE

## Security-First Admin Management

This system uses Firebase Console for secure admin role assignment - no hardcoded emails in the frontend code.

## 🚀 How to Make Someone Admin (SECURE METHOD)

### Step 1: User Creates Account
1. User goes to `/profile` and creates a regular account
2. System automatically assigns `customer` role (default)

### Step 2: Admin Assignment via Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your `deeplyrooted-b1fd5` project
3. Go to **Firestore Database**
4. Navigate to `users` collection
5. Find the user document (by email)
6. Edit the document
7. Change `role: "customer"` to `role: "admin"`
8. Save changes

### Step 3: Admin Login
1. Admin goes to `/admin-login`
2. Logs in with their regular credentials
3. System verifies admin role from Firestore
4. Grants access to admin panel

## 🛡️ Security Features

✅ **No hardcoded admin emails** in frontend code
✅ **Server-side role verification** via Firestore
✅ **Manual admin assignment** through Firebase Console only
✅ **Separate admin login** page with role checking
✅ **Admin role stored securely** in Firestore database

## 🚫 What This Prevents

- Frontend code inspection revealing admin emails
- Automatic admin privilege escalation
- Unauthorized admin access
- Security vulnerabilities from hardcoded credentials

## 📝 Admin Management Process

1. **Create Account** → Customer role assigned automatically
2. **Firebase Console** → Manually change role to admin
3. **Admin Login** → Secure verification and access

This approach ensures only authorized personnel can assign admin roles through the secure Firebase Console interface.

# Admin Setup Guide - Deeply Rooted E-commerce

This comprehensive guide will help you set up and manage admin users for your Deeply Rooted e-commerce application.

## 🎯 Overview

The application uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore for user management with role-based access control. By default, all new users are created with the "customer" role. Admin privileges must be assigned manually for security reasons.

## 🔐 Making a User an Admin

### Method 1: Firebase Console (Recommended for First Admin)

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your "deeplyrooted" project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
4. Find the `users` collection
5. Locate the user document (search by email or UID)
6. Edit the document and change the `role` field from `"customer"` to `"admin"`
7. Save the changes
8. The user will need to log out and log back in to see admin features

### Method 2: Admin Panel (Once you have at least one admin)

1. Log in as an existing admin user
2. Navigate to `/admin/customers`
3. Find the user you want to promote
4. Click the **shield icon** to toggle their admin status
5. Changes take effect immediately

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

- **Never create admin users automatically** through registration code
